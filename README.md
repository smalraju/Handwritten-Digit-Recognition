# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Humans can see and visually sense the world around them by using their eyes and brain. Computer vision works on enabling computers to see and process images in the same way that human vision does. Several algorithms are developed in the area of computer vision to recognize images. 
The goal of our work will be to create a model that will be able to identify and determine the handwritten digit from its image with better accuracy. 

We aim to complete this by using the concepts of Convolutional Neural Network and MNIST dataset. 
Though the goal is to create a model which can recognize the digits, we can extend it for letters and then a personâ€™s handwriting. 
Through this work, we aim to learn and practically apply the concepts of Convolutional Neural Networks.
